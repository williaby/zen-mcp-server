# Prepare-PR Tool - Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

**Status**: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED  
**Date**: 2025-08-08  
**Tool Name**: `prepare-pr`

## Overview
AI-enhanced pull request preparation with intelligent branch strategy analysis and automated GitHub integration.

## Purpose
- Complex PR workflow automation
- Phase-aware development support  
- Intelligent change analysis
- Automated documentation generation
- GitHub integration optimization

## Source Command Reference
**Original Implementation**: `/home/byron/dev/PromptCraft/.claude/commands/workflow-prepare-pr.md`  
**Complexity**: 955 lines of sophisticated bash scripting  
**Key Features**: Branch validation, phase-aware workflows, dependency management, GitHub integration, What The Diff integration

## Architecture Decisions

### ADR-001: Base Class Selection
**Decision**: Inherit from `WorkflowTool`  
**Rationale**: 
- Complex multi-step workflow with systematic progression required
- Branch strategy analysis needs investigative phases with AI reasoning
- PR description generation benefits from conversation memory and context building
- Integration with zen's conversation threading for complex analysis
- Enables detailed investigation and synthesis across multiple workflow steps

### ADR-002: Migration Strategy - Why Convert This Command
**Decision**: Convert the 955-line workflow-prepare-pr bash command to MCP tool
**Rationale**:
- **Complexity Justification**: 955 lines of bash with complex business logic becomes unmaintainable
- **AI Enhancement Value**: Intelligent branch strategy recommendations vs rigid rule-based validation
- **Context Benefits**: Conversation memory allows building context across git history, change analysis, and PR generation
- **Error Handling**: Sophisticated error recovery and user guidance vs basic bash error handling
- **Testing**: Full integration testing framework vs limited bash testing capabilities
- **Maintainability**: Python class structure vs increasingly complex bash script maintenance

### ADR-003: AI Integration Points - Where AI Adds Value Over Bash Rules
**Decision**: Leverage AI for intelligent analysis, keep deterministic operations as structured logic  

**AI-Enhanced Features**:
- **Branch Strategy Analysis**: Analyze change patterns, commit history, and project context to suggest optimal branching
- **PR Description Generation**: Generate contextual, comprehensive PR descriptions from commit analysis and change patterns
- **Change Impact Assessment**: Intelligent risk assessment and reviewer suggestions based on change complexity
- **Conflict Resolution**: Smart suggestions for branch strategy conflicts and workflow optimizations
- **Reviewer Assignment**: Analyze change patterns and suggest appropriate reviewers based on expertise areas

**Deterministic Operations** (keep as structured logic):
- Git command execution and status checking
- File system operations and validation
- API calls to GitHub
- Template variable substitution
- Cost tracking and budget management

### ADR-004: Branch Strategy Analysis - Intelligent vs Rule-Based
**Decision**: Hybrid approach with AI-enhanced decision support  

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
def analyze_branch_strategy(self, git_context, change_patterns, commit_history):
    # Deterministic rule validation first
    basic_validation = self.validate_basic_branch_rules(git_context)
    
    if basic_validation.has_conflicts:
        # AI reasoning for complex conflict resolution
        ai_analysis = self.get_ai_branch_strategy_recommendation(
            context=git_context,
            patterns=change_patterns,
            history=commit_history,
            conflicts=basic_validation.conflicts
        )
        return self.synthesize_branch_recommendation(basic_validation, ai_analysis)
    
    return basic_validation
```

**Rationale**: 
- Maintains fast, deterministic validation for clear-cut cases
- Leverages AI reasoning for complex scenarios requiring judgment
- Provides intelligent guidance while preserving rule-based safety

### ADR-005: PR Description Generation - Template-Based vs AI-Generated
**Decision**: AI-generated content with template structure and variable population  

**Implementation**:
```python
def generate_pr_description(self, analysis_context):
    # Use AI to generate content for each template section
    sections = {
        "summary": self.ai_generate_pr_summary(analysis_context),
        "changes": self.ai_analyze_change_impact(analysis_context), 
        "testing": self.ai_generate_testing_guidance(analysis_context),
        "architecture": self.ai_assess_architectural_impact(analysis_context)
    }
    
    # Populate structured template with AI-generated content
    return self.populate_pr_template(sections, analysis_context.metadata)
```

**Rationale**:
- AI generates contextual, comprehensive content vs static templates
- Maintains structured format for consistency and tool compatibility
- Reduces manual PR description effort while improving quality
- Leverages git history and change analysis for better descriptions

### ADR-006: Model Selection Strategy - Role-Based Analysis
**Decision**: Use plugin-style architecture with specialized model assignment for different workflow aspects  

**Model Assignments**:
```python
WORKFLOW_MODEL_ROLES = {
    "branch_analysis": {
        "models": ["o3-mini", "gemini-2.5-flash"],
        "focus": "logical reasoning, rule analysis, decision trees"
    },
    "change_impact": {
        "models": ["deepseek-r1", "qwen3-coder"], 
        "focus": "code analysis, architectural impact, technical assessment"
    },
    "pr_description": {
        "models": ["gemini-2.5-pro", "o3"],
        "focus": "comprehensive writing, context synthesis, documentation"
    },
    "reviewer_assignment": {
        "models": ["o3-mini", "gemini-2.5-flash"],
        "focus": "pattern recognition, team dynamics, expertise matching"
    }
}
```

**Cost Management**:
- Target value tier models (â‰¤$10 output/M) for cost effectiveness
- Dynamic model selection based on current availability and pricing
- Budget controls with intelligent fallback strategies
- Detailed cost tracking per workflow phase

### ADR-007: Architecture Approach - Plugin-Style Implementation
