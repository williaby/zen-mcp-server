## PR Description Template

```markdown
# Add Plugin-Style Custom Tools Architecture with QuickReview Implementation

## Summary
Implements a zero-merge-conflict plugin architecture for custom tools and delivers the first tool: **QuickReview** for basic validation using free models.

## Key Features
- üîå **Plugin Architecture**: Zero-conflict custom tools in `tools/custom/`
- ü§ñ **QuickReview Tool**: Basic validation with 2-3 free models ($0 cost)
- üì± **MCP Interface**: Optimized from 19 to 12 parameters (37% reduction)
- üîç **Auto-Discovery**: Automatic tool registration with minimal core changes
- üìö **Comprehensive Docs**: Complete implementation and design guides

## Implementation Details
- **Minimal Integration**: Only 5 lines added to `server.py`
- **Self-Contained**: All custom tools in isolated `tools/custom/` directory
- **Git-Independent**: No merge conflicts with upstream changes
- **Test Coverage**: Self-contained testing with validation framework

## Files Added/Modified
### New Files
- `tools/custom/__init__.py` - Auto-discovery system
- `tools/custom/quickreview.py` - QuickReview implementation  
- `tools/custom/test_quickreview.py` - Self-contained tests
- `docs/custom-tools.md` - Comprehensive custom tools guide
- `docs/development/adrs/*.md` - Architecture Decision Records

### Modified Files
- `server.py` - Added 5 lines for custom tool loading

## Testing
- ‚úÖ Self-contained tests pass
- ‚úÖ Server integration validated  
- ‚úÖ MCP interface optimized
- ‚úÖ Auto-discovery system working
- ‚úÖ Zero merge conflicts confirmed

## Usage
```bash
quickreview proposal:"Check this code syntax" focus:"syntax" files:["src/auth.py"]
```

## Benefits
- **Zero Merge Conflicts**: Plugin architecture prevents upstream conflicts
- **Cost Effective**: Free models only for basic validation ($0 cost)
- **User Friendly**: Clean MCP interface with essential parameters
- **Extensible**: Foundation for tier 2 (review) and tier 3 (criticalreview) tools

## Next Steps  
- Implement **review** tool (tier 2) using same plugin architecture
- Add **criticalreview** tool (tier 3) for critical decisions
- Expand model selection and role-based analysis

Closes #[issue-number] if applicable
```

## Post-PR Actions

### Immediate (After Merge)
- [ ] Update project README if needed
- [ ] Notify team about new custom tools capability
- [ ] Start development of **review** tool (tier 2)

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Gather user feedback on QuickReview tool
- [ ] Monitor model availability and performance
- [ ] Begin **review** tool implementation

### Medium Term (1-2 months)  
- [ ] Complete **review** and **criticalreview** tools
- [ ] Add advanced features based on user feedback
- [ ] Consider specialized domain tools (secreview, perfreview)

## Risk Mitigation

### Deployment Risks
- **Model Availability**: QuickReview includes robust fallback handling
- **Interface Changes**: MCP optimization maintains backward compatibility
- **Integration Issues**: Minimal server changes reduce risk

### Monitoring Points
- Custom tool auto-discovery functionality
- Free model availability and performance  
- User adoption of new tool
- MCP interface usability

## Success Criteria
- [ ] PR merged without conflicts
- [ ] QuickReview tool working in production
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Users can successfully use QuickReview via MCP
- [ ] Foundation ready for tier 2 and 3 tools
