# Model Selection Framework for 25-Model Curated Set

## Overview
This framework establishes quantitative criteria for selecting and maintaining a curated set of 25 AI models across different price tiers, capabilities, and organizational levels. It enables automated evaluation of new models and replacement recommendations.

## Model Allocation Structure

### Price Tier Distribution (Total: 25 models)
```
Free Tier: 8 models (32%) - Higher redundancy due to availability issues
Value Tier: 6 models (24%) - Balanced cost/performance 
Premium Tier: 6 models (24%) - High-performance for critical tasks
Specialized: 5 models (20%) - Niche capabilities (coding, reasoning, multimodal)
```

### Organizational Level Distribution
```
Junior Level: 8 models (primarily free + some value)
Senior Level: 10 models (value + premium balance)  
Executive Level: 7 models (premium + top specialized)
```

### Capability Matrix Requirements
```
General Purpose: 8 models (32%) - Broad task handling
Coding Specialists: 6 models (24%) - Development tasks
Reasoning Experts: 5 models (20%) - Complex analysis
Multimodal: 3 models (12%) - Vision + text
Conversation: 3 models (12%) - Chat optimization
```

## Quantitative Selection Criteria

### Primary Metrics (70% weight)
1. **Performance Benchmarks (30%)**
   - HumanEval Score (coding capability)
   - SWE-Bench Score (software engineering)
   - MMLU Score (general knowledge)
   - HellaSwag Score (common sense reasoning)

2. **Cost Efficiency (25%)**
   - Input cost per million tokens
   - Output cost per million tokens  
   - Performance-to-cost ratio calculation

3. **Technical Specifications (15%)**
   - Context window size
   - Processing speed (tokens/second)
   - Reliability/uptime metrics

### Secondary Metrics (30% weight)
1. **Strategic Value (15%)**
   - Provider diversity (avoid single points of failure)
   - Unique capabilities not covered by existing models
   - Future roadmap and support commitment

2. **Operational Factors (15%)**
   - API availability and rate limits
   - Regional availability
   - Terms of service compatibility

## Model Replacement Decision Matrix

### Automatic Replacement Triggers
A new model should replace an existing model if it meets **ALL** of the following:

1. **Performance Superiority**: 
   - ≥10% improvement in primary benchmark scores within same price tier
   - OR ≥5% improvement with ≥20% cost reduction

2. **Capability Coverage**:
   - Maintains or improves existing capability coverage
   - Does not create gaps in the capability matrix

3. **Strategic Alignment**:
   - Fits within price tier allocation limits
   - Maintains provider diversity requirements
   - Aligns with organizational level needs

### Replacement Priority Scoring Formula
```
Replacement Score = (Performance_Improvement * 0.4) + 
                   (Cost_Efficiency_Gain * 0.3) + 
                   (Strategic_Value * 0.2) + 
                   (Operational_Benefits * 0.1)

Threshold for Replacement: Score ≥ 7.5/10
```

## Automated Evaluation Process

### Phase 1: Basic Qualification
```python
def qualifies_for_evaluation(model_data):
    """Basic qualification check"""
    return (
        model_data.context_window >= 32000 and
        model_data.has_api_access and
        model_data.performance_benchmarks_available and
        model_data.pricing_available
    )
```

### Phase 2: Quantitative Analysis
```python
def calculate_replacement_score(new_model, existing_models):
    """Calculate if new model should replace existing model"""
    
    # Find best replacement candidate from same tier/capability
    candidates = filter_replacement_candidates(existing_models, new_model)
    
    for candidate in candidates:
        score = {
            'performance': calculate_performance_improvement(new_model, candidate),
            'cost_efficiency': calculate_cost_efficiency_gain(new_model, candidate),  
            'strategic_value': calculate_strategic_value(new_model, candidate),
            'operational_benefit': calculate_operational_benefit(new_model, candidate)
        }
        
        total_score = sum(score[k] * weights[k] for k in score.keys())
        
        if total_score >= 7.5:
            return {
                'should_replace': True,
                'target_model': candidate,
                'score': total_score,
                'reasoning': generate_replacement_reasoning(score, new_model, candidate)
            }
    
    return {'should_replace': False}
```

### Phase 3: Strategic Review
Models with replacement scores ≥ 7.5 trigger automated analysis reports including:
- Performance comparison charts
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Capability gap analysis  
- Implementation timeline
- Risk assessment
