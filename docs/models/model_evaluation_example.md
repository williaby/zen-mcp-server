# Model Evaluation Example: GPT-5 Assessment

## Scenario
Evaluating whether GPT-5 should replace an existing model in our 25-model curated set.

## Input Data
**OpenRouter URL**: `https://openrouter.ai/openai/gpt-5`

**Extracted Metrics**:
```python
new_model = ModelMetrics(
    name="openai/gpt-5",
    provider="openai", 
    humaneval_score=90.0,
    swe_bench_score=80.0,
    mmlu_score=88.5,
    hellaswag_score=92.1,
    gsm8k_score=95.2,
    input_cost=5.0,    # $5/M tokens
    output_cost=15.0,  # $15/M tokens  
    context_window=400000,
    api_availability=99.5,
    has_multimodal=True,
    has_vision=True
)
```

## Replacement Analysis

### Identified Candidates
Based on price tier (premium) and capabilities (general purpose + reasoning), the following existing models are candidates for replacement:

1. **anthropic/claude-opus-4** (current executive model)
2. **openai/gpt-4-turbo** (current senior model)  
3. **google/gemini-pro-1.5** (current multimodal model)

### Quantitative Scoring

#### Candidate 1: Replace claude-opus-4
```python
existing_model = ModelMetrics(
    name="anthropic/claude-opus-4",
    humaneval_score=85.2,
    mmlu_score=86.1, 
    input_cost=15.0,
    output_cost=75.0,
    context_window=200000,
    api_availability=99.2
)

score_breakdown = {
    "performance": 7.8,    # +5.6% HumanEval, +2.8% MMLU improvement
    "cost_efficiency": 9.2, # 80% cost reduction on output ($75 -> $15)  
    "strategic_value": 8.1,  # Larger context (400K vs 200K), maintains provider diversity
    "operational_benefit": 6.5 # Slight availability improvement
}

weighted_score = (7.8 * 0.4) + (9.2 * 0.3) + (8.1 * 0.2) + (6.5 * 0.1) = 8.05/10
```

**Result**: ✅ **REPLACEMENT RECOMMENDED** (Score: 8.05 ≥ 7.5)

### Reasoning
"Significant cost savings: -80.0% output cost reduction | Larger context window: 400,000 vs 200,000 tokens | Performance improvement: +5.6% on key benchmarks"

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Testing & Validation (Week 1)
- Deploy GPT-5 in test environment
- Run benchmark validation tests
- Validate API integration with existing tools
- Performance regression testing against Claude Opus 4

#### Phase 2: Gradual Rollout (Week 2)
- Replace Claude Opus 4 in 10% of executive consensus operations
- Monitor performance metrics and cost impact
- Collect user feedback from consensus tools
- Scale to 50% if metrics show improvement

#### Phase 3: Full Deployment (Week 3)
- Replace Claude Opus 4 completely in executive tier
- Update model allocation configurations
- Monitor system stability for 48 hours
- Document performance gains and lessons learned

#### Success Metrics
- Performance improvement ≥ 7.8/10 target
- Cost efficiency ≥ 9.2/10 target  
- No service disruptions during transition
- Executive consensus quality maintained or improved

#### Rollback Plan
Automatic rollback to Claude Opus 4 if:
- Performance drops >5% in first 24 hours
- Costs increase >20% from projected savings
- API availability drops below 99%
- User satisfaction scores decline

## Expected Impact

### Quantitative Benefits
- **Cost Savings**: ~$60/M tokens reduction in output costs
- **Performance Gain**: 5.6% improvement in coding benchmarks
- **Context Enhancement**: 2x larger context window (200K → 400K tokens)
- **Capability Addition**: Enhanced multimodal and vision processing

### Strategic Advantages  
- **Maintains Provider Balance**: Keeps OpenAI representation within limits (≤6 models)
- **Technology Leadership**: Adopts latest generation model technology
- **Competitive Positioning**: Ensures access to cutting-edge AI capabilities
- **Future-Proofing**: Positions system for next-generation model requirements

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Factors
- ✅ OpenAI proven reliability and support
- ✅ Significant quantitative improvements across all metrics
- ✅ Maintains capability coverage (general purpose + reasoning + multimodal)
- ✅ Cost reduction provides budget flexibility

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of consensus quality metrics
- **Phased Rollout**: Gradual deployment to minimize impact of any issues
- **Rapid Rollback**: Automated reversion if thresholds are breached
- **User Training**: Update documentation for any API or capability changes

## Conclusion

**STRONG RECOMMENDATION**: Replace anthropic/claude-opus-4 with openai/gpt-5

The quantitative analysis shows compelling advantages across all evaluation criteria, with particularly strong cost efficiency gains while maintaining or improving performance. The 8.05/10 replacement score significantly exceeds the 7.5 threshold, indicating this is a high-confidence recommendation that aligns with strategic objectives for the 25-model curated set.

This replacement enhances system capabilities while reducing operational costs, positioning the model selector for future requirements while maintaining the robust fallback strategies essential for production reliability.
