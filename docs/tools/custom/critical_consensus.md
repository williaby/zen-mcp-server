# Critical Consensus Tool - Executive Leadership Level Analysis

**Get strategic consensus from executive leadership perspective using premium models and C-level roles**

The `critical_consensus` tool simulates getting strategic input from executive leadership, using top-tier premium models with executive-level roles appropriate for critical decisions, major architectural choices, and enterprise strategic planning.

## Thinking Mode

**Not applicable.** Critical consensus uses predetermined executive-level models and C-level roles - the underlying consensus analysis handles any required reasoning at the model level.

## Model Recommendation

Critical consensus automatically selects from premium-tier models to provide maximum capability and performance for strategic decisions requiring comprehensive executive analysis. Models are chosen for advanced reasoning, strategic thinking, and enterprise-level expertise.

## How It Works

Critical consensus provides executive leadership level analysis through a strategic approach:

1. **Premium model selection**: Automatically chooses 6-8 top-tier models from the curated executive list
2. **C-level roles**: Assigns executive leadership roles appropriate for strategic decision-making
3. **Comprehensive analysis**: Optimizes for maximum capability regardless of cost for critical decisions
4. **Strategic consensus orchestration**: Uses the core consensus engine with executive-level parameters
5. **Strategic reporting**: Shows which models and roles were used with executive context and cost transparency

## Example Prompts

**Enterprise Architecture Decision:**
```
zen critical_consensus "Should we adopt a new enterprise architecture strategy moving to cloud-native microservices?"
```

**Strategic Technology Investment:**
```
zen critical_consensus "Should we invest $2M in migrating our entire infrastructure to Kubernetes and service mesh?"
```

**Crisis Response Strategy:**
```

## When to Use Critical Consensus vs Other Tools

- **Use `critical_consensus`** for: Strategic decisions, enterprise architecture, major investments, crisis response
- **Use `review_consensus`** for: Production decisions, professional analysis, senior staff authority level
- **Use `basic_consensus`** for: Development decisions, junior-level analysis, cost-conscious choices
- **Use `layered_consensus`** for: Comprehensive analysis requiring multiple organizational levels
- **Use `quickreview`** for: Quick validation without comprehensive strategic analysis

## Organizational Authority Context

Critical consensus represents the highest tier in organizational decision-making:

**Executive Leadership Authority Level:**
- Enterprise architecture and strategic technology direction
- Major technology investments and strategic initiatives
- Crisis response and business continuity planning
- Innovation strategy and competitive positioning
- Strategic risk management and enterprise governance

**Strategic Decision Scope:**
- Enterprise-wide technology strategy and architecture
- Major system migrations and platform decisions
- Strategic technology investments over $1M
- Crisis response and incident management strategy
- Innovation roadmap and competitive technology positioning

**Budget and Resource Alignment:**
- Matches financial authority of C-level executives and board decisions
