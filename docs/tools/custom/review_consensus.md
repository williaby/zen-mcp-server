# Review Consensus Tool - Senior Staff Level Analysis

**Get professional-grade consensus from senior staff perspective using value-tier models and experienced roles**

The `review_consensus` tool simulates getting technical input from senior staff professionals, using professional-grade value models with experienced roles appropriate for production-level decision making.

## Thinking Mode

**Not applicable.** Review consensus uses predetermined senior-level models and professional roles - the underlying consensus analysis handles any required reasoning at the model level.

## Model Recommendation

Review consensus automatically selects from value-tier professional models to balance cost with performance, providing reliable senior-level technical analysis. Models are chosen for professional-grade capabilities and proven reliability.

## How It Works

Review consensus provides senior staff level analysis through a comprehensive approach:

1. **Professional model selection**: Automatically chooses 5 value-tier models from the curated professional list
2. **Senior-level roles**: Assigns professional IT roles appropriate for senior staff members
3. **Balanced cost/performance**: Optimizes for professional-grade analysis within reasonable budget
4. **Expert consensus orchestration**: Uses the core consensus engine with senior-appropriate parameters
5. **Detailed professional reporting**: Shows which models and roles were used with professional context

## Example Prompts

**Production Architecture Decision:**
```
zen review_consensus "Should we migrate our monolith to microservices for our e-commerce platform?"
```

**Technology Migration:**
```
zen review_consensus "Is it worth migrating from MySQL to PostgreSQL for our main database?"
```

**Security Implementation:**
```
zen review_consensus "Should we implement OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for our mobile app authentication?"
```

**Performance Optimization:**
