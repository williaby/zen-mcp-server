## 🚀 How to Use

### Enable Routing
Set the environment variable and restart the server:
```bash
export ZEN_SMART_ROUTING=true
./run-server.sh
```

### Monitor Status
Use the built-in routing status tool:
```bash
# General status
routing_status action=status

# View available models by level
routing_status action=models

# Get usage statistics  
routing_status action=stats

# Get model recommendation
routing_status action=recommend prompt="Debug this Python error" context='{"files":["bug.py"],"error":"ValueError"}'
```

### Configuration
Edit `routing/model_routing_config.json` to customize:
- Model level assignments
- Complexity thresholds
- Cost optimization settings
- Routing preferences

## 🛡️ Tool-Specific Exclusions

**Layered Consensus Protection**: The system automatically excludes `layered_consensus` and `LayeredConsensusTool` from dynamic routing, preserving your custom model selections while optimizing all other tools.

### Configuration
```json
// In routing/model_routing_config.json
"tool_specific_rules": {
  "layered_consensus": {
    "enabled": false,
    "reason": "User has customized model selection - preserve existing configuration"
  },
  "LayeredConsensusTool": {
    "enabled": false,
    "reason": "User has customized model selection - preserve existing configuration"  
  }
}
```

### Additional Exclusions via Environment
```bash
export ZEN_ROUTING_EXCLUDE_TOOLS="layered_consensus,my_custom_tool"
export ZEN_SMART_ROUTING=true
./run-server.sh
```

**To enable: Set `ZEN_SMART_ROUTING=true` and restart the server!**

**Your layered consensus tool will work exactly as before while all other tools get intelligent routing!**
